## So, what is this repository about?

This repository was created to provide a simple and effective method for blocking ads and trackers on Spotify. By modifying your system's hosts file, you can redirect Spotify ad servers to prevent ads from being served during music playback. However, because Spotify has implemented new ad-serving techniques, this method is no longer effective in blocking ads. This repository is now deprecated and no longer maintained. A good thing though, is that the hosts file blocks trackers and other unwanted connections.

### How to Block Trackers on Spotify

To block trackers effectively, you can modify your system's hosts file to redirect Spotify tracking servers to a local or null IP address. This will prevent Spotify from collecting data on your listening habits and other activities. Here's how you can block trackers on Spotify:

1. **Download Hosts File:** Obtain a custom hosts file designed for ad and tracker blocking. You can find various hosts files on GitHub or through internet searches.
   
2. **Update Hosts File:** Edit your system's hosts file to include the entries from the custom hosts file you downloaded. This will redirect known ad and tracker domains to a local or null IP address.

   - **Windows:** Modify `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
   - **Mac/Linux:** Edit `/etc/hosts` file.

3. **Apply Changes:** Save the hosts file and restart your system to apply the changes.
